## Introduction
Welcome to the Flatdango project! In this project, we'll be building a Single Page Application (SPA) for searching movies from a public API. The frontend of this application will be built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap (or Tailwind), and it will interact with the public API to fetch movie information.

## Project Goals
Design and architect features across a frontend.
Communicate and collaborate in a technical environment.
Integrate JavaScript and an external API.
Debug issues in small- to medium-sized projects.
Build and iterate on a project MVP.
## Project Setup
Create a new project folder.
Create a new GitHub repository (ensure it is private).
Add your TM as a contributor to the project.
Regularly commit your work to the repository.
## Requirements
The app must be a HTML/CSS/JS/Bootstrap or Tailwind frontend.
It must access data from a public API asynchronously using JSON.
The entire app should run on a single page with no redirects.
## Features
See the details of the first movie (poster, title, runtime, showtime, and available tickets) when the page loads.
View a menu of all movies on the left side of the page when the page loads.
Buy a ticket for a movie. The number of available tickets should decrease on the frontend.
Add at least 3 separate event listeners (e.g., DOMContentLoaded, click, change).
Implement some form of interactivity (e.g., add a "like" button or comments).
## Stretch Goals
Use json-server for persisting interactivity.
Click on a movie in the menu to replace the displayed movie's details.
Indicate if a movie is sold out by changing the button text and adding a class.
Strategy and Timeline
## Planning:

Plan out your features and develop user stories.
Decide on the structure of your JSON requests.
Pitch your project idea to instructors for approval and feedback.
MVP ASAP:

Build a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) quickly.
Explore the API early on to ensure it meets your needs.
Instructor Guidance:

Seek instructor guidance on design from the start.
Use the rule of 10s for debugging small issues.
Guidelines for Staying Organized
Write down decisions about your project.
Describe and sketch your ideas.
Create a frontend directory with basic files.
Build enough code to get some API data.
Continue building features one by one.
## JSON Server Instructions (Optional)
If using json-server, a template is provided to generate backend code link = https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/json-server-template
Alternatively, create a db.json file with your desired structure.
Run json-server --watch db.json to start the server.
Consult the json-server docs for more information.
